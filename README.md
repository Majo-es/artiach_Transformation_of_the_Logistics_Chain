## Case Study #2: Transformation of the Logistics Chain

### Company Context:

| Aspect | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Type & Sector** | Food Product, perishable/long shelf life, dry product. Second player with approx. **13%** market share. |
| **Acquisition** | Recently acquired by a Spanish Multinational from a Global Multinational. The purchase agreement **did NOT include Operations/Supply Chain**. |
| **Organization** | New General Director (**DG**) recently incorporated. Organizational chart includes Supply Chain. Low impact of logistics cost on the P&L statement. |
| **Activity Volume** | Annual sales of **$25,000,000$ kgs**. Management of **90 references/SKUs**. **70-80 orders/day**. |
| **Customer Base** | Distributors (**10%**) and Retail-Large Distribution (**90%**). |

### 1. The Flawed Initial Situation (The Trap):

The UN inherits a fragmented, dependent, and unprofessionalized Supply Chain setup:

* **Logistics Dependence:** The entire physical flow relies on the seller's remnants (Central Warehouse next to factory managed by a small family business, distribution through a Logistics Operator with interfaces to the seller's systems). The trap is believing this arrangement can be sustained long-term post-acquisition.
* **Planning Vacuum:** The Matrix/Holding company has **"NO experience in Planning,"** and the quick fix was a shallow, four-week consultancy project. The trap is continuing to manage production based on centralized demand forecasts without an integrated, professional S&OP process.
* **Customer Service Immaturity:** No order taking is done; everything is via "Autoventa" (Sales/Self-selling). Order entry is manual (2 people), separated from the S.C. function, and reports to Sales. The trap is lacking control over the crucial "order signal" that drives the entire Supply Chain.

## 2. The Proposed Solution: Supply Chain Transformation and Professionalization

The General Director (DG) must initiate a project to establish a modern, controlled, and efficient Supply Chain. The transformation is detailed in five key ideas:

### Idea #1 & #2: Planning & Inventory Transformation (S&OP)

The action is to **Implement a Robust Sales & Operations Planning (S&OP) Process** to provide internal expertise and alignment.

| Action Area | Strategic Goal | Detail (Solution Steps) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **S&OP Process** | Establish cross-functional alignment. | **1. Create Team:** Incorporate a Demand Planner and a Production Planner. **2. Monthly Cycle:** Hold meetings with Sales, Marketing, S.C., Finance, and Production to align demand. **3. Tools:** Use shared Excel initially; plan for ERP implementation later. |
| **Inventory**| Focus management on high-value products (90 SKUs). | **1. Analysis:** Perform **ABC Analysis** on the 90 references. **2. Forecast Focus:** Focus forecast precision efforts on **Class A SKUs**. **3. Safety Stock:** Define Security Stocks by product class (higher for A, lower for C). |

### Idea #3 & #4: Logistics Transformation (From Dependence to Control)

The action is an **Immediate Transition to a Professional 3PL** over two phases (Short-Term: Stabilization; Long-Term: Strategic Partnership).

| Phase | Strategic Goal | Detail (Solution Steps) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Short-Term (Idea #3)** | Stabilize the Central Warehouse (CW) and de-risk operations. | **1. Technology:** Invest in a simple, proprietary **WMS (SGA)** for the central warehouse in Bilbao. **2. Evaluation:** Substitute the small family business and evaluate existing Logistics Operators (OLs). |
| **Long-Term (Idea #4)** | Secure a strategic, cost-effective distribution network. | **1. New 3PL:** Search for and contract a new **Strategic 3PL** that can integrate transport, storage, and final distribution. **2. Differentiated Distribution:** Route **Class A products** directly from the factory to the 3PL's **Cross-Docking hubs** to reduce costs and improve service. |

### Idea #5: Processes and Control (KPIs)

The action is to **Implement Basic Measurement** to track the success of the transformation.

* **Forecast Accuracy (Precisión del Forecast):** Measures the quality of the demand forecast versus actual sales.
* **Production Plan Reliability (Fiabilidad del Plan de Producción):** Measures how close actual production is to planned production.
* **Service Level (Nivel de Servicio):** Measures the percentage of orders delivered on time and complete (OTIF).
* **Stock-out (Rotura de stock):** Measures product availability (number of times a product was out of stock).

### 3. The Resulting Outcome (The Crisis Avoided):

By executing this transformation, the UN:

* **Gains Control:** Establishes independent, professional logistics, eliminating the high risk of service disruption from the seller's remnants.
* **Improves Efficiency:** Replaces informal planning with a formal S&OP process, reducing inventory holding costs (avoiding the Case 1 trap of excessive stock) and improving service reliability (avoiding stock-outs).
* **Professionalizes the Core:** Integrates customer orders directly into the S.C. function, ensuring that the service promise is logistically feasible and profitable.
